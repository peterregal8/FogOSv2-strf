### strftime and strfmon

This pull request implements two new functions to the user library, strftime and strfmon. Both of these involve formatting a string according to certain conversion specifications. Documentation for each of these functions, as well as build and testing instructions, can be found in docs/strftime.md and docs/strfmon.md.
